# TriviaGame

In this webpage on load you will see a jumbotron with a start button that will begin the timer, and quiz.
When start is clicked you are taken to a "different" page with the timer running and the quiz questions. At the bottom of the question page is a submit button for the user to click when all the questions are answered. If the timer hits 0 before the questions are answered you will be taken to the Game Over screen where the results of your quiz will be printed. You are also taken to the Game Over page once you hit submit.
